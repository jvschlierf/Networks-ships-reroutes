# Final Project Simulation & Modeling - Network Simulation of global shipping & rerouting due to network changes

Project for Simulation & Modeling Course in the MSc. Data Science & Business Analytics at Bocconi University.

## Abstract:

The maritime transportation system, fundamental to the world economy, relies on the correct functioning of important straits and canals, the so called “choke-points”. Using graph theory to simulate the features of the maritime transport network when important paths are no longer viable, we demonstrate the strategic importance of such narrow passages. Furthermore, implementing an Agent-based Model, we investigate the decision making of individual ships which reroute in case of choke-point faults. We find that the blockage of the Strait of Malacca would lead to most profound effects, since the major trading routes would be unavailable, with some of the most connected nodes becoming unreachable and the ship agents becoming stuck. Also, we find some evidence that early response to a blockage may lead to higher distances travelled by ships, which leads to higher costs of fuel.
